My grandfather who died few years ago was a World War II Veteran. As an Amy Wheeled Vehicle Mechanical, he was sent to South East Asia. His duty was maintaining and repairing destroyed military vehicles. I gained my life because God allowed him to survive countless air-raids and shelling. I sometimes think of the reason why he was able to avoid bombs from bombers and machine-gun fire from combat aircraft raining down to his military motor garage. 

One of the greatest reason why I chose missiology as my academic research area is a question he asked to me when he was alive. He asked me "Why Christ died on the cross?" I was not able to answer well but God used the experience to give me passion to come up with better and better answer equipping me to contribute for evangelism. Now I explain the far better answers to my own child in the morning devotion time.

I spent the day December 7th more than 10 times in United States as a Japanese, a foreigner. In any of those 10 chances, my American friends never talked to me about what day was it. I just spent those days as normal busy working day. Maybe I just didn't cared public events. Until today, I never know that this days was actually the military force once my grandfather belonged to attacked Pearl Harbor. My grandfather was a military officer of Japan.

Japanese education system taught me Hiroshima and Nagasaki in detail putting those 2 dates precisely into my memory but never taught me to remember the other date.

My child is dual citizen of United States and Japan. It is impossible for him to choose either side. Can he be split into 2 half persons and half remember Pearl Harbor, and the other half remember Hiroshima? No. It does not happen. What he can remember is, the fact that the war is not the act of love. War breaks the commandment of Jesus Christ to love enemy. 

I would teach him both dates. I will tell him the story of his great grandfather who was a Japanese mechanic in the war zone who became friend with an American captive mechanic. The story of none believer who not knowingly kept the commandment of the Son of God. I will tell him the only way the 2 of his nations never fight again is only accepting Jesus Christ as personal Lord and savior, obey and do what He commanded, and being united as God's family.
