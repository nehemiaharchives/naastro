"You used to be a reporter for Christianity Today Japan. You are also a grandstudent of Dr. Takeo Miyamura, who was the editor-in-chief. Would you be willing to succeed Dr. Miyamura as editor-in-chief?"

After thinking and praying for a while after receiving the offer, several events came to my mind that made me think, "That was a sign that God was working for this. Through these events, I began to think that God was calling me to this path, and I have been working as the editor-in-chief since December 2019.

When I saw this unknown young man newly appointed as the editor-in-chief of Christianity Today Japan, people might think, "Who is this person?" I would like to take this opportunity to share my testimony. I think I am about a third of the way through my life. I would like to take this opportunity to reflect on what God has done for me from before I was born until now. This is a long article, but I would appreciate it if anyone who is interested could read it.

Come and hear, all you who fear God. I will declare what he has done for my soul. (Psalms 66:16)
