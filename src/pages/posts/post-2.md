Greetings from the eidtor in chief. 

"Given a station, even though there are a lot of people using it, there are no churches around it", if we can find out locations of such stations, it would be helpful to Christians who are selecting potential sites for church planting.

In this article, we would like to introduce the significance of the project, and the motivation and background of its development.
