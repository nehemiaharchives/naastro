Let's assume a role play of battle in the fields of intelligence, political, and public opinion manipulation between [red team](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/61702155e90e07197867eb93/20210625-Red_Teaming_Handbook.pdf): CN, NK (hostile against Christianity) vs. blue team: US, SK, JP (partially hostile partially friendly toward Evangelical Christianity). A war game to gain military advantage [without using armed force](https://cryptome.org/2014/06/prc-three-wars.pdf) starting from 1950s to present. If I were red team strategist, I will send espionage to educate/raise/train far left ideological activists, sympathizers, and followers in religious organizations, as well as media and schools in blue nations. 

I will let them aim for higher rank in their organizations to obtain decision making power. I will let them pretend to promote “world peace” to denuke ONLY blue nations, weaken JP SDF by worshiping “the article 9 of Japan’s constitution” instead of Jesus Christ. Majority of them only see surface of ideological activity and emotionally swayed ending up following the movement without knowing true intent of red. That's intent of red. Only few agitators, propagandists, radical educationists is enough to know the true intention. 

I would ask them to visit Japan, co-work with Japanese [anti Gov leftist Christian faction](https://untijpj-la-coocan-jp.translate.goog/yamanouchi/jpj-yamanouchifile_03.html?_x_tr_sch=http&_x_tr_sl=ja&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en-US), let them pretend that they represent 500M opinions of Christians around the world and spend 20 min to meet next PM who is non-believer to preach about only nuke and “9” instead of Gospel or religious freedom. It could have been once in a lifetime opportunity for a busy politician in a country where Christian population is less than 1% to see a Christian leader who was able to witness, and the chance got wasted.

Oh yes, if you read Japanese, you can stand at the starting point of verification if that already happened in 2014 as similar event was [covered](https://www.christiantoday.co.jp/articles/13785/20140804/wcc-chang-sang-suga-yoshihide.htm) in Christian Today Japan.

For those who never imagined that Japan has been the front line of the actual ideological-proxy-cold-war as much brutally fought as in US until now, welcome to “the REAL Japan”.

To make things clear, I'm an Evangelical Christian. Regardless of nationality, I support some liberals when they genuinely help sick, poor and social minorities when they do NOT intend to use them as disposable weapon for ideological war. I support them because I think it's love in action and Biblical.

On the contrary, I oppose some right nationalist conservatives when they hate and try to kick out foreign residents if they genuinely try to live and work in the country and are not criminals nor sent by foreign government for seeking military advantage. I oppose them because I think it's not love in action and not Biblical.

I support Biblically right actions with motive of divine love shown in the cross of Jesus Christ regardless of political views of the person.

I think it’s good to denuke ALL nations if there are no exceptions. I see sustainable energy source as solution to nuclear power problems. I’m not against “9”. I also love “world peace”. I promote world without war where nobody killed not because I can use the term “peace” to sugarcoat red strategy to gain military advantage over blue, but because “peace” is fundamental requirement for the efficient accomplishment of world mission.

I hope the same thing can be said for the usage/misuse of the term "BLM". BLM should not be misused to disguise compassion and justify killing, looting, rioting to destroy blue countries from inside to achieve red military advantage. I support BLM only when the term represent actions of love which was taught by our Lord Jesus Christ which equally deal with people as brothers and sisters regardless of the skin color.

Please pray for newly appointed Prime Minister of Japan, Yoshihide Suga for the opportunity for him to find out Jesus as Christ, as his Personal Lord and Savior. Pray for effective and realistic dialogue and cooperation with Japanese government and 600M Evangelicals of the World and Japan to contribute achievement of long waited religious freedom in red countries where our brothers and sisters suffer and killed every day because of their faith.

(I usually read English articles and do not write in English because my primary audience is those who read in Japanese regardless of race, nationality, and geographic location. Majority of readers are racially Japanese with citizenship of Japan and located in Japan. But there are also Japanese diaspora and learners of Japanese as second language around the world. There are also foreign missionaries, students, immigrants, personnel of For-profit and Nonprofit or government agency live/work in Japan. Some of them and their families sometimes reside Japan for generations without citizenship of Japan keeping non-Japanese mother tongue and culture. Some of them are just visiting few months. Some of them have racially culturally diverse background. I wrote this because I thought it's new to some people and it also explains my views to the English speakers in a timely manner.)
