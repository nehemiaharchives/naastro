When a war breaks out, State tries to use Church. It does so to win the public mind, to give authority legitimacy, and to control easily. It is scary to fight against its huge power. Few people have the courage to risk their lives. If I were there, would I be able to speak up? When I think about it, I realize I'm not qualified to judge those who were willing to but couldn't.

In every era, in every country, in every war, there were Christians who stood up for justice and faith. Some paid the price with their lives. There were also those who failed to do so. They lived a long life in tears of regret and sorrow. Both of them went to heaven. Both are God's beloved children. I am called to be a neighbor to both of them.

I'll try my best to do the right thing. Even if I am unable to do so because of my weakness, I at least try the next best thing. I pray "Please let me do Your will". I ask for the strength and for anything needed for me to do so. In the face of a war, fought by the powerful kings, Christians may be powerless. But I believe in Jesus Christ, the King of kings, and I follow him.

Share rooms with those who have nowhere to sleep, feed the hungry, and clothe the freezing. For sure these are good things, and nobody opposes nor criticizes you by doing so. Then how about loving our enemies despite being condemned by our friends? Can I pray for someone whom I think is completely wrong? Can I pray for wrongdoers, that they will receive guidance for repentance rather than divine punishment? I ask myself.
When God asks, "When this person whom I love was completely wrong, did you pray for him to turn back to Me?" I wonder what I would answer. In the midst of tragedy, how can I be together with, comfort, and show love to those who had no choice but to curse that there is still no God? I don't have that kind of love in me. So I want to seek God's love.

Behind the many deaths, many lies, and many sorrows, there are Christians who love, serve and give. The power that sustains them is the love of God that taught by, lived in, and showed through the death on the cross and resurrection of Jesus Christ. It is the glory of God that is expressed by their good lives, and it is the name of God that is glorified.

Hallowed be Thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. In the face of war, if our heart is in such deep pain that we can't even squeeze out a word of prayer, at least pray this. What is the greatest need of a world at war? I believe that God's will is to make a world with ones who love their enemies. They do so by overcoming hate and condemnation towards those who are forced to fight against them. They do so in spite of criticism and ridicule from their own friends.
